For an application where it is clocked using a crystal, CLKOUT is not needed, ADE7912 so only two channels. 

DREADY provides active low pulse for 64 CLKIN pulses (15.625us) when ADC conversion data is available
All data transfer operations synchronize to the serial clock.
Data shifts into the ADE at the MOSI input on falling edge of SCLK, and the ADE samples data on the rising edge of SCLK.
Data shifts out of the ADE at the MISO output on falling edge of SCLK, and is sampled by the master on the rising edge of SCLK.
MSB is shifted in and out first.
SCLK freq supported are 250kHz-5.6MHz
At power up or reset, uC reads STATUS0 register to detect when Bit 0 (RESET_ON) clears to 0
Drive the CS input low for entire data transfer operation

ADC Output Values:
Code from ADC can vary between 0x800000 (-8,388,608) and 0x7FFFFF (+8,388,607); this is equivalent to an input signal of +/-49.27mV on current channel and +/-0.788V on voltage channels. However stay within recommended limits of 31.25mV and 0.5V respectively.
If applied 31.25V on IWV or 0.5V on V1WV/V2WV, ADC output code is nominally 5,320,000.
IWV, V1WV, V2WV: Three 24-bit signed registers. Rate defined by Bits 5,4 in CONFIG. 

SPI operation:
uC sets CS low, send one command byte on MOSI. 
Command byte composition:
1,0 : Don't care
2: READ_EN: 0 for Write, 1 for Read operation
7,6,5,4,3: Address of register to be read or written

READ: (Bit 2 was set to 1):
After receiving last bit of command byte, ADE begins transmitting contents onto MISO line when next SCLK H->L transition occurs
After uC receives the last bit, it sets CS and SCLK high and communication ends
Temperature is read on V2WV for ADE7912 always and TEMP_EN has no significance.

Burst Mode: Output registers (IWV, V1WV, V2WV, ADC_CRC, STATUS0, CNT_SNAPSHOT) all read together in a burst
Initiated when uC sends command byte = 000001XX(=0x04) (IWV register address = 00000)
ADE sends each register in the above order, one at each SCLK H->L transition

WRITE: (Bit 2 was set to 0):
After sending command byte, master sends 8 bit value of register immediately on next H->L transition. 
After executing a write operation, read it back once to ensure it was written correctly

Synchronizing multiple devices (not sure if needed): 
Bits 5,4 in CONFIG register select ADC output frequency
SYNC_SNAP used only to synchronize multiple ADC outputs
Bit 0 in CONFIG will be 0 for DREADY functionality

POWER UP AND INITIALIZATION PROCEDURES:
1. Read STATUS0 register until Bit 0 is cleared to 0.
2. Initialize CONFIG and EMI_CTRL register
3. Set lock register to 0xCA to protect user accessible and internal config registers
3. Read all 6 output registers in SPI burst mode

SOFTWARE RESET: 
Bit 6 in CONFIG set to 1 for reset. All internal registers go to default values. 

HARDWARE RESET: 
Happens when CS and MOSI pins are kept low for 64 SCLK cycles. Equivalent to sending eight bytes equal to 0x00 to the ADE7912.

POWER DOWN:
Bit 2 of CONFIG register if set to 1, turns off the ADC but registers maintain their values

Bandwidth of antialiasing filter can be set in CONFIG register by bits 7,5,4.

SPI Mode: CPHA=1, CPOL=1
Clock idle state is 1
First clock signal falling can be used to prep the data
The data is captured on the clock's low-to-high transition and propagated on high-to-low clock transition.
Seems like SPI_MODE3
